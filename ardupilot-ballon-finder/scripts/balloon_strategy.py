"""
This is an early guess at a top level controller that uses the DroneAPI and OpenCV magic
to try and win the challenge.

General approach:
* A state machine will need to know if we are in the portion of the route where we should even
be looking for balloons (by looking at vehicle mode == AUTO and between wpt #x and #y?)
* Periodically grab openCV frames and ask the image analysis function if it thinks there
is a balloon there and if so - what direction should we go.
* Initially we use current vehicle position + orientation + camera orentation to do a GUIDED
goto for a wpt beyond where the vehicle should go.
* If our altitude gets too low, or we get too far from the 'bee-line' path, abandon looking for
this particular balloon (to prevent crashing or wasting too much time looking for balloons)
* Until vehicle enters auto mode the strategy will only look for balloons (and generate
log messages
* If there was a mavlink message for telling the vehicle to shoot for a particular heading/altitude
rather than just going to wpts that might be a good optimization

To run this module:
* Run mavproxy.py with the correct options to connect to your vehicle
* module load api
* api start balloon-strategy.py

or

* execute linux_run_strategy.sh

Then arm it an takeoff as in mavproxy_sequence.txt
